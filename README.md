# CatGPT üê±

Welcome to CatGPT, a GPT-3.5-turbo (the model that runs ChatGPT) model that behaves like a cat! Ask it anything and it will give you the purrfect response!

## How to use

To use CatGPT, you can either use the [CatGPT](https://catgpt.guru) website or fork this repository and run it yourself.

To run it yourself, you'll need to install the dependencies with `yarn install` add your API key to a `.env` file and run `yarn dev` to start the server. You can then access the website at `localhost:3000`. And BOOM! You're ready to go!
